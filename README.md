[Left Arm IK Stretch](https://github.com/Steven-Goehrig/rigging-scripts/blob/main/L_arm_IKStretch.py){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}: Automates the creation of the necessary connections for the IK system to squash and stretch. Written with Cmds.

[Left Foot Smart Roll](https://github.com/Steven-Goehrig/rigging-scripts/blob/main/L_foot_smartRoll.py){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}: Automates various elements of a foot roll in order to assist with the animation of walk cycles. Written with Cmds.

[Limb Matching](https://github.com/Steven-Goehrig/rigging-scripts/blob/main/limbMatching.mel){:target="_blank" rel="noopener"}: Creates a UI tool for matching the translation and orientation of FK limbs to IK limbs and vice versa in order to enable seamless animations when switching between systems.
